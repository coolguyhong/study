            <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to
                instantiate, by using explicit annotation style
                (see script.js for details)

        <div>
            I can add: 

            <p>The controller could not be instantiated, due to relying
                on automatic function annotations (which are disabled in
                strict mode). As such, the content of this section is not
                interpolated, and there should be an error in your web console.
